This implementation contains an extension of seq2seq tutorial for conversation models in Tensorflow:

> Option to use Beam Search and Beam Size for decoding

Currently, it supports

    - Simple seq2seq models
    - Attention based seq2seq models

To get better results use beam search during decoding / inference.
